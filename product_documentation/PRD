Pricing Strategy
Pricing Transparency and User Experience
Main Page Display:
Each tour listing will feature a "Starting at" price prominently to give users an idea of the minimum cost.
It conveys affordability and encourages exploration of the offerings.

Detailed Pricing Upon Selection:
Once a user selects a specific tour and date, the system will display the actual cost based on various factors, including seasonality and availability.
This approach maintains transparency while managing user expectations effectively.

Considerations for Pricing Strategy
Seasonality:
Prices may vary based on the peak and off-peak seasons. The system should dynamically adjust the "Starting at" prices based on these variations.

Customizable Add-On Packages:
Users can see the base price initially, with additional excursions offered as optional packages displayed during the booking process.

Single vs. Double Bookings:
Different pricing modules for solo travelers versus couples. The initial display should reflect the price for a double booking per person.

User Flow Considerations
Price Disclosure Timing:
Ensure the actual cost breakdown is shown after date selection to ensure clarity but avoid deterring users during the initial browsing phase.

User Interface Elements:
Clear tooltips or information icons to explain any factors affecting the "Starting at" price.
